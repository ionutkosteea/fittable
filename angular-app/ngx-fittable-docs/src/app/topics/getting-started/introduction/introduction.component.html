    Fittable is a powerful software component that provides advanced capabilities for managing large tables with
    spreadsheet-like functionality. Built using Angular and Typescript, it offers a dynamic table model, a robust
    operation execution mechanism, and a flexible user interface that can be easily customized to meet your specific
    needs.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    The main module of Fittable is developed in Angular, which presents a responsive and interactive view for the
    application. The view model and other essential modules are written in Typescript, without any dependency on a GUI
    framework, making it possible to use the component on the server-side as well.

  <p class="description">
    Fittable's modules are highly adaptable, with a range of configurable options that allow you to customize the
    component to match your application's requirements.
